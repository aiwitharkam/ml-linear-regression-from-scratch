# 📈 Linear Regression from Scratch

This project implements Linear Regression using just Python and NumPy — no machine learning libraries. It's part of my learning journey into AI and machine learning.

## 🚀 What’s Inside:
- A basic `LinearRegression` class
- Training on a small dataset (Boston Housing or synthetic)
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Gradient Descent
- Graphs using matplotlib

## 📁 Project Structure:
- `src/model.py`: Linear regression model
- `src/utils.py`: MSE function and plotter
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages list
- `notebook/`: (To be added later)


## 🔧 How to Run
-`Copy`
-`Edit`
-`pip install -r requirements.txt`
-`jupyter notebook`

## 📚 Skills Practiced

- `Python`
- `NumPy`
- `Gradient Descent`
- `Linear Algebra`
- `Data Visualization (matplotlib)`
- `Jupyter Notebook`
