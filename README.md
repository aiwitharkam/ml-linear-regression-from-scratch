# 📈 Linear Regression from Scratch

This project implements Linear Regression using just Python and NumPy — no ML libraries. It's part of my learning journey into AI and machine learning.

## 🚀 What’s Inside:
- A basic `LinearRegression` class
- Training on a small dataset (Boston Housing or synthetic)
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Gradient Descent implementation
- Visualization of results

## 📁 Project Structure:
- `notebook/`: Jupyter notebook to test and visualize
- `src/`: Python modules for cleaner code
- `data/`: (Optional) Sample CSV dataset

## 🔧 To Run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebook/linear_regression.ipynb
